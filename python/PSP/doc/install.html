    <h1>Building Python for PSP</h1>

    <p>I only tested  the build on Linux, always  using the latest PSP
    SDK and toolchain.  This should only be a  matter of typing "make"
    in the PSP subdirectory of the python source root.</p>

    <h1>Running scripts</h1>

    <p>Once EBOOT.PBP is  installed on your Memory Stick,  you can run
    it as  any homebrew.  When  launched, the interpreter will  try to
    find a "script.py"  file in its directory and run  it; if there is
    none, it will exit with an error message.</p>

    <h1>Standard modules</h1>

    <p>In addition  to the  regular built-ins, the  following standard
    modules are available:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>time</li>
      <li>math</li>
      <li>struct</li>
      <li>binascii</li>
      <li>_random</li>
      <li>cStringIO</li>
      <li>errno</li>
      <li>thread</li>
      <li>collections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you  want to use the  pure Python modules, you  have to copy
    them to &lt;MS&gt;/python where  &lt;MS&gt; represents the root of
    your Memory Stick. The modules are in the Lib/ subdirectory of the
    Python source root.</p>

    <h1>Additionnal modules</h1>

    <p>PSP-specific APIs are partially wrapped; for now it's better to
    use  the higher-level  API in  the  <a href="psp2d.html">psp2d</a>
    module. The Subversion repository also includes some samples.</p>
