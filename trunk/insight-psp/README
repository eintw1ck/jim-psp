psp-insight.

These are a couple of patches for Redhat's Insight debugger, basically
gdb with a tk gui. There are two patches, one is for the latest official
release of insight (6.1) the other targetted against the latest snapshot
at time of writing (6.30.50.20050912). Hopefully the snapshot patch
should continue to work for a fair period as most of the patching is done 
in libopcode/libbfd which by now is relatively stable.

NOTE: Seems when built for mips insight 6.1s register window craps out
locking up the application, unless you just cannot get the CVS one working
dont use 6.1.

Usage:

Download either the stable 6.1 or the latest CVS snapshot from the download
page at http://sources.redhat.com/insight

Extract the source. In the source dir type patch -p1 < ../insight-6.1.patch
(replacing the patch name with the CVS one if using a snapshot). Ensure it
has patched correctly.

Finally type configure --prefix=/usr/local/pspdev --target=psp, then make
and make install to build and install it.

Have fun.
