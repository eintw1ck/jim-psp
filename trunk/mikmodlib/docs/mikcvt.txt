
 --> MikMod Sound System  v3.0
  -> UniFormat Conversion Program (MIKCVT.EXE)



-/- Introduction
================

 MikMod utilizes its own internal format called UniMod (or UniFormat).
 This internal format can 100% accurately represent any of the modules
 that MikMod supports.  The advantage of UniMod is that the programmer
 can convert all modules of any type to this native MikMod format, and
 simply include the UniMod loader alone into the program.

 For more information about UniMod, see UNIMOD30.TXT.

 MikMod comes with a program called MIKCVT.EXE, which converts modules
 to the UniMod format.  MIKCVT will load any module supported by
 MikMod, optimize and compress the pattern data, and save out a file
 with the .UNI extension.  MIKCVT also supports wildcards, so that you
 can easily convert several modules at a time.


-/- Distribution
================

 MIKCVT is a totally free utility, and can be downloaded separately
 from MikMod.  MIKCVT comes with full source code, and the programmer
 can feel free to modify this source code in any way for PERSONAL use
 only (to rearrange the format to prevent module ripping for instance).
 PLEASE DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE A MODIFIED VERSION OF MIKCVT.  The last
 thing anyone wants is to have odd non-std versions of UniMod modules
 floating around.



-/- Usage
=========

 MIKCVT has a very simple command line interface, as follows:

   MIKCVT  [-strip] infile [infile] [infile] ...

   MIKCVT  song1.s3m song2.xm
   MIKCVT  -strip *.s3m
   MIKCVT  *.*

 The first example shows the general syntax of MIKCVT.  Note that
 -strip is optional, but if present MUST be the first option on
 the command line.

 In any instance, the -strip is optional, and if present will tell
 MIKCVT to remove all text strings from the module.  This includes
 the title, sample names, instrument names, comments and other forms
 of text.  This feature is generally intended for use by game and demo
 developers, who may not require such information in the release pro-
 duct.

 
-/- Miscellaneous
=================

 There will probably be a future version of MIKCVT that will further
 optimize modules in -strip mode.
