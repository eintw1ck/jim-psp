PRXTool: A simple tool to manipulate Sony PSP(tm) PRX files.

PRXTool is licensed under the AFL v2.0. Please read the LICENSE file for further 
information.

This README is going to be short and to the point.

Installation:

Do the old ./bootstrap and ./configure thing, then type make (or gmake). You can
then install the tool if you want using make install.

Example:

./bootstrap; ./configure; make; make install

Usage:

Prxtool has three main functions, parsing PRX files and outputting an IDA Pro
IDC script to load in symbols, outputting an XML file of symbols or post-processing
ELF or PRX files to either make them work or work better for disassembly. I don't
fancy explaining more than that :)

Anyway this is a good companion to libdoc as that provides the XML file used to 
get names and such for functions.
