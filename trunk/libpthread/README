pthread Library by Raf (rafpsp<at>gmail<dot>com)
--------------------------------------------------

This is a very simple pthread library implementation (/wrapper). It only features
the most basic functions. Any enhancements are most welcome.
As it is now, it is sufficient to satisfy Links2 pthread requirements.

To make, run:
-------------------------------

user$> make all

To install, as root run:
-------------------------------

root$> make install

-------------------------------
2006-04-04, raf: Starting a simple pthread library.
2006-05-08, raf: Changed default thread stack size from (almost) 4KB to 8KB.
		 Also, now threads delete themselves correctly when exiting. (in other words, leak corrected).
		 Added option to set pthread attributes: stacksize/scope(sytem(kernel)/process(user))/priority
