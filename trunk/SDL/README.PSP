Building
--------
To build for the PSP, make sure psp-config is in the path and configure as follows:

   export LDFLAGS="-L`psp-config --pspsdk-path`/lib -lc -lpspglue -lpspuser"
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure --host psp --prefix=`psp-config --pspsdk-path`/.. --disable-threads

followed by make, make install.  The --disable-threads bit is temporary.


SDL_main
--------
When writing an SDL program, the typical use is to write your main
function as "SDL_main", then link -lSDLmain which provides the real
main().  In this implementation, -lSDLmain will:
  - Define the required PSP_* macros
  - Set up the "home" button callback.
  - Initialize the debugging screen
  - Call the user-supplied SDL_main
  - When it returns, delay 2.5 seconds, then exit to VSH.

Of course, you can leave off -lSDLmain, and write the real main()
yourself if you need more control than this.

By default, the PSP "sdl-config --cflags" will define main=SDL_main.


Building applications
---------------------
Write your source file as you would a normal SDL program.  Use the
standard Makefile as supplied with sdktest.  Above the final "include"
line, add:

PSPBIN = $(PSPSDK)/../bin
CFLAGS += `$(PSPBIN)/sdl-config --cflags`
LIBS += `$(PSPBIN)/sdl-config --libs`
USE_NEWLIB_LIBC = 1


Building autoconf applications
------------------------------
The general way to build autoconf applications is to add the psp
architecture to configure.in, then use --with-sdl-prefix to point to
the proper sdl-config.  For example, to build the applications in the
test/ subdirectory, use:

  export LDFLAGS="-L`psp-config --pspsdk-path`/lib -lc -lpspglue -lpspuser"
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --host psp --with-sdl-prefix=`psp-config --pspsdk-path`/.. 


Libc
----
SDL is linked against newlib's libc, and your SDL programs should be
too.  Linking against psplibc will appear to work but may behave
strangely at runtime.


Status
------
   Video - yes, single 32-bit ABGR framebuffer surface only; SDL will
           emulate other formats as necessary.  Needs HW accel.  No 3D.
  Timers - yes
   Audio - no
 Threads - no
Joystick - no
   Mouse - no
Keyboard - no
