SDL test application by Jim Paris <jim@jtan.com>

This application demonstrates the parts of SDL that work on the PSP,
and how to build against the PSP SDL library.  Make sure psp-config is
in your $PATH and compile with:
  
   make

Notice how sdltest.c has no PSP-specific code.  This same code can
be compiled and executed on your PC:

   make pc
   ./sdltest-pc

It demonstrates:
   Video
   Multiple timers and threads
   Joystick input
     Press button 0 (TRIANGLE) to clear the screen, any other button to exit
