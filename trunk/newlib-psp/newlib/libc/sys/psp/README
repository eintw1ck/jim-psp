Newlib for PSP
--

This sys/psp directory depends on PSPSDK headers.  It expects them to live in
${prefix}/psp/sdk/include (see newlib/configure.host).

I used automake 1.4-p6 to generate aclocal.m4 and Makefile.in:

	aclocal -I ../../..
	automake --cygnus

Autoconf refused to work for me, so I copied configure from sys/sh and modified
$ac_unique_file to point libcglue.c.
