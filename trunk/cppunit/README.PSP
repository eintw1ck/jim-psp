cppunit unit testing framework
-----------------------------

WARNING: THIS DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK

I had been attempting port cppunit to psp, but have run into problems.
After working through some other problems, it appears cppunit requires
rtti and exceptions, which the homebrew psp toolchain does not seem to
currently support.  The lib will build but is not usable AFAICT.

The config.sub and makefiles have been changed.  Dllplugintester, examples,
and docs are removed from makefiles and no longer built, for varying reasons.

I'm commiting this in the hope someone will some day get things working to
the point in which cppunit can be used on psp.

To attempt building use the following commands:

 $ CXXFLAGS="-G0" LDFLAGS="-L$(psp-config --pspsdk-path)/lib -lc -lpspuser" \
	./configure --host psp --prefix=$(psp-config --psp-prefix)

 $ make
 $ make install


(NOTE: For those not familiar with unix, '$' is the typically prompt symbol,
 and is often used in docs to denote a command that needs to be run)
