
 --> MikMod Sound Libraries Version 3.0
  -> Known Bugs - August 20st, 1997


 If anyone knows of a fix for any of the bugs listed below, please contact
 me at dracoirs@epix.net and tell me about it.

 - The DSM loader has been changed from MikMod 2.10 to 3.0 and is un-
   tested.  It may not work.
 
 - 669 loader is far from perfect.  Thanks go out to the complete lack of
   useful docs for this format.  It seems to play most 669's adequately,
   however.

 - Since there is no 100% sure detection of UST / Soundtracker the 15-
   instrument loader may, under very rare circumstances, detect a sound-
   tracker module as UST and play it incorrectly.

 - MikMod locks Aztec soundcards (SB clones distributed with Packard Bell
   computers).  MikMod will work, but it hard locks the card and the
   user must turn off the computer to reset it (Windows can't even do it!)

   This bug may not exist anymore; someone tell me if it does.
