to build this

- put tinyxml library into ./pspdis/tinyxml (or edit the makefile to fit)
- create a configured binutils source (step 1 of the newtoolchain script)
- edit the makefile to point to the location of the binutils source
- copy psplibdoc.xml into ./pspdis

after this pspdis should build by issuing "make"
