Quite explainatory note for the branch.

The point of this branch is for me to explore other ways of doing
things without being tied to maintaining backwards compatibilty
for all users of pspsdk. It is really a playground for me.

The main aim of this is to fashion the sdk to target more towards
the creation of prx files instead of elfs, elfs will still be 
supported but limited in scope to what you can do in the normal
sdk.

Don't rely on any of this code to work all the time :P
