Just a few notes.

Firstly, you _must_ have a working copy of prxtool in your path (for the moment). Without it you cannot
convert from the elf to a prx. Secondly DO NOT strip the prx file as it will currently break it, you
have been warned.

Please note that you cannot simply turn your regular program elfs into prxes using prxtool. You MUST
fashion your program after the one contained in this directory. That is, your makefile must use 
'module_start' instead of 'main' and your makefile must include build_prx.mak instead of build.mak.
To start out it is probably easiest to modify the sampel to get a feel for things. If you want to
export more functions you must add them to the "export our function" section of exports.exp and
also add them to the stub that is included in prx_loader so that it gets linked in. If you
change the name of your module you also have to change its name in the PSP_EXPORT_START macro in
exports.exp and in the stub that prx_loader uses. DO NOT add any entries to the 'syslib' exports
in exports.exp
 
And to test this prx file out try the prx loader which is supplied as a second sample in this
directory. Just copy the mymodule.prx to the root of the memory stick and install the EBOOT for 
prx_loader where you see fit, then run it.

That is all.
