Just a few notes.

Firstly, you _must_ have a working copy of prxtool in your path (for the moment). Without it you cannot
convert from the elf to a prx. Secondly DO NOT strip the prx file as it will currently break it, you
have been warned.

And to test this prx file out try the prx loader which is supplied as a second sample in this
directory. Just copy the mymodule.prx to the root of the memory stick and install the EBOOT for 
prx_loader where you see fit, then run it.

That is all.
