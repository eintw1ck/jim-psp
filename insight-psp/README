psp-insight.

This is a patch for the Redhat Insight GDB Debugger version 6.4. It provides
a simple GUI to help make GDB just that little bit easier to use.

Usage:

Download the stable Insight 6.4 from http://sources.redhat.com/insight

Extract the source. In the source dir type patch -p1 < ../insight-6.4.patch.
No errors should be printed during this operation.

Finally type ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/pspdev --target=psp, then make
and make install to build and install it.

Have fun.
